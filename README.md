# Course Description: Biomedical Data Science Bootcamp

This course will introduce participants with little or no prior experience in programming, statistics, or scientific computing to the foundations of biomedical data science. Working in small teams of two or three students, students will learn foundational data science skills by creating Python computer programs that address biological and health-care case studies. Cases will be analyzed in terms of what data are generated and consumed in the case, and how that data can be represented, visualized, and analyzed so as to address the biological or healthcare challenge.

The course will use combinations of short pre-recorded lectures and coding demonstrations, class discussions, large and small group programming and learning exercises, seminars, code reviews, and visualization gallery strolls.
