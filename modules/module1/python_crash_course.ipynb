    "The Greek philosopher Pythagoras reportedly said, \"All is number!\". Deep down in the computer, Pythagoras is correct but in this course we are primarily going to think of data as consisting of **strings** and **numbers**. Adopting a physical metaphor, we can say that numbers and strings are our atoms of data. We can then combine numbers and strings to create molecules of data.\n",

    "An object has\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attributes: Attributes are characteristics of the object (e.g. height, weight, color (Think adjectives))\n",
    "1. Methods: Methods are functions that operate on the characteristics (data) of the object (Think verbs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important components of the programs we will be writing are **data objects** and **function objects.** Using a biology analogy, data objects are like the blood circulating through our bodies and function objects are like our organs that take blood in and return modified blood and some biological behavior.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have focused on two types of data: numbers and strings. Technically, a string is an example of a Python data structure: a collection of basic data (atoms), in this case, a character. But since Python does not have a single character data type, strings end up being a bit of a hybrid. Other data structures that come with Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list)\n",
    "* [tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple)\n",

    "* [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, lists are the work horse and dictionaries are the most powerful of the Python data structures. Since we will run across each of these data structures as we work with third-party data structures (e.g. Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames), we will quickly go over the syntax and basic nature of each of them.\n",

    "* lists are **mutable**: lists can change; I can add, delete, and modify elements of the list\n",
    "* Like strings, lists are indexed with square brackets\n",
    "* Lists are defined with square brackets:\n",
